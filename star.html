      <h1>Description for star</h1>
      <p>A regular star shape, also known as a regular star polygon, is a self-intersecting equilateral and equiangular polygon. It was created by connecting one vertex of a simple, regular, n-sided polygon to another non-adjacent vertex and this is continued until the original vertex is reached again.</p>
