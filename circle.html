    <h1>Description for circle</h1>
    <p>In Maths or Geometry, a circle is a special kind of ellipse in which the eccentricity is zero and the two foci are coincident. A circle is also termed as the locus of the points drawn at an equidistant from the centre. The distance from the centre of the circle to the outer line is its radius. Diameter is the line which divides the circle into two equal parts and is also equal to twice of the radius.</p>
