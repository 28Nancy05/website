    <h1>Description for square</h1>
    <p>In Geometry, a square is a two-dimensional plane figure with four equal sides and all the four angles are equal to 90 degrees. The properties of rectangle are somewhat similar to a square, but the difference between the two is, a rectangle has only its opposite sides equal. Therefore, a rectangle is called a square only if all its four sides are of equal length.</p>
